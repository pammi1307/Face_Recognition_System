# Face_Recognition_System
**Face Recognition using Haar-Cascade Classifier, OpenCV and Python.**

This project is based on face detection and face recognition processes. It is a real time web cam face detection and recognition project which will be used to generate training face images and then detect the known faces. It classifies between known and unknown faces.

# Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Any necessary additional libraries (requirements listed in requirements.txt)

# Installation
1. conda install -c conda-forge face-recognition  

2. conda install -c conda-forge imutils   

3. conda install -c conda-forge opencv    

4. conda install -c anaconda requests

# Structure
- **'encode_faces'/**: Contains images for training the model.
- **'haarcascade'/**: Haar-Cascade Classifier files for face detection.
- **'pi_face_recognition.py'/**: Main script for running the face recognition system.
- **'requirements.txt'/**: List of dependencies.
